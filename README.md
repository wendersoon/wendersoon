Hello, I'm glad you're here. Welcome to my github profile!

My name is Wenderson, I'm a Computer Science student and I'm already in the 7th period. I really like areas related to technology and mathematics, I'm a python programmer and I'm constantly learning new things.
This is my github, here you will find the projects I worked on or am currently working on, feel free to explore and send me a message if you like. I'm open to suggestions and criticism :)
