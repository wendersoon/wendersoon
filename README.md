I am a Computer Science student scheduled to graduate in the first semester of 2024. I have expertise in Python, supported by two years of practical experience in personal and freelance projects. My constant commitment to excellence is reflected not only in the application of knowledge in Python, but also in the Javascript and Golang languages.

My proficiency extends to GNU/Linux environments, GIT for version control, API concepts, database manipulation and much more. I am also deeply involved in the active study of Clean Architecture and Clean Code concepts, aiming to constantly optimize the quality of my work.

I'm excited to apply my passion for technology and dedication to continuous learning to deliver great work, looking forward to taking on challenges and adding significant value in future professional opportunities.
